# Using FEniCSx for the study of self-gravitating fluids

This will (hopefully) be the location of all numerical experiments pertaining to self-gravitating ellipsoids, conducted by the Cohl group at [https://www.nist.gov/itl/math](NIST, Applied and Computational Mathematics Division). The [https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html](Jupyter book) format allows for code and output to display on the same page, with markdown and enriched text.

The experiments here are currently being conducted using FEniCSx. FEniCSx is the latest version of the [https://fenicsproject.org/](FEniCS project); it is an open-source computing platform for solving PDEs with the finite element method. The code here is adapted from the FEniCSx tutorial, which can be found [https://jorgensd.github.io/dolfinx-tutorial/](here). 

Some important references for this project include [https://tohline.education/SelfGravitatingFluids/index.php/Main_Page](an extensive wiki) on self-gravitating fluids by Professor Joel Tohline, and Dr. Howard Cohl's [http://hcohl.sdf.org/](personal research site).

More references, and links, soon.
